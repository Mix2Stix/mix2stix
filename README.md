# Mix2Stix version 2
Mix2Stix fills your mp3 player with random files.

## Aim of this project
Version 1 of Mix2Stix is doing its job just great, get it at [https://mix2stix.de](https://mix2stix.de).<br>
The code is hosted at Codeberg: [https://codeberg.org/azett/Mix2Stix_v1](https://codeberg.org/azett/Mix2Stix_v1)

But its author built it maaany years ago, the code quality is rather poor. So this project here is planned to become version 2 of Mix2Stix. It will be coded from scratch, with proper code quality and much more possibilities to be extended.
